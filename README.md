## 🔧 Usage Examples

### Sign Up
```bash
POST /signup
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "password": "securePassword123",
  "name": "John Doe"
}
```

### Complete Onboarding

POST /onboarding
Authorization: Bearer <jwt-token>

{
  "message": "Hey! Let's connect!"
}
```

### Get Stream Chat Token
```bash
GET /chat/token
Authorization: Bearer <jwt-token>
```

## 🔐 Authentication Flow

1. User signs up with email, password, and name
2. Verification email is sent (optional, can be bypassed)
3. User verifies email or is auto-verified
4. User logs in with credentials
5. Server generates JWT token and sets HTTP-only cookie
6. User completes onboarding with additional profile info
7. Stream Chat user is created/updated
8. Protected routes verify JWT token from cookie

## 🤝 Friend System Flow

1. User searches for friends or views suggestions
2. User sends friend request with optional message
3. Receiver gets notification of friend request
4. Receiver accepts or declines request
5. On acceptance, both users are added to each other's friends list
6. Friends can now chat and call through Stream Chat

## 🎥 Stream Chat Integration

The backend automatically integrates with Stream Chat when users:
- **Sign up**: User is created in Stream Chat
- **Complete onboarding**: User profile is updated in Stream Chat
- **Login**: User receives Stream Chat token for authentication

This enables the frontend to connect to Stream Chat for:
- Real-time messaging
- Video and audio calls
- Group chats
- Message history
- Online/offline status

## 🧪 Testing

Use the included `tests.http` file with REST Client or similar tools to test all API endpoints.

For frontend integration, ensure your client application can:
- Handle JWT tokens in cookies
- Connect to Stream Chat using provided tokens
- Make authenticated requests with credentials: 'include'
- Handle CORS from allowed origin (http://localhost:5173)
